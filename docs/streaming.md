# Streaming

The Nuitka development has become richer by Kay developing online once in a while. This has a lot of constraints to address, but it will happen on a regular basis.

!!! tip "Live Development"
    Watch live Nuitka development sessions where you can learn about the internals, ask questions, and see new features being built in real-time.

## :material-help-circle: Why Stream?

Streaming provides an opportunity to:

- **Learn Nuitka internals** by watching live development
- **Ask questions directly** to the main developer
- **Suggest improvements** and discuss features
- **See complex problems solved** in real-time
- **Understand the development process** behind a Python compiler

## :material-video-camera: How to Watch

### Discord Integration

On Discord, we have a Streaming room. There is a "react" bot that you can use to be automatically notified by Discord when a stream is started. Join our Discord server: [https://discord.gg/nZ9hr9tUck](https://discord.gg/nZ9hr9tUck){ target="_blank" rel="noopener" }

### Platform

The main streaming platform is **YouTube** on Kay's channel: [https://www.youtube.com/c/KayHayen](https://www.youtube.com/c/KayHayen){ target="_blank" rel="noopener" }

### Chat Options

- **Discord Chat:** Primary chat for live interaction
- **Gitter Mirror:** The main chat on Gitter is linked to the Discord chat room for people not on Discord

!!! info "Call-in Feature"
    Discord can be used for a call-in part where Kay can un-mute people and discuss one-on-one with viewers live on air, answering questions directly.

## :material-calendar: When We Stream

**Typical Schedule:**
- **Days:** Usually weekends
- **Duration:** Full day sessions with breaks
- **Time Zones:** CEST (Central European Summer Time)
- **Format:** Morning session + afternoon/evening session

**Session Structure:**
- Morning development session
- Lunch/sports break
- Afternoon/evening continuation
- This essentially becomes a full work day on Nuitka

!!! note "Family Schedule"
    The exact times depend on Kay's family situation. Start dates are announced several days ahead of time on Twitter and via the Discord streams react bot.

## :material-code-tags: What We Work On

### Typical Stream Content

**Challenging Technical Topics:**
- Code specialization improvements (e.g., making `INT`, `LONG`, and `CLONG` work better)
- Performance optimizations for operations like `some_int += 2`
- Website improvements and updates
- Specific optimization implementations

**Regular Activities:**
- Project status reports
- General clarification sessions
- Planned improvements that haven't been tackled yet
- Community-suggested features and fixes

### Stream Goals

!!! example "Past Successful Streams"
    Previous streams have successfully covered website improvements, specific optimizations, and general development work. The interactive format works really well for both education and development.

## :material-bell: Announcements

### How to Stay Informed

**Advance Notice:**
- **Friday:** Topic announcement via blog post and/or Twitter
