# Donation

Nuitka is an effort, mainly driven in my spare time.

For travels to Python conferences, web site costs, etc. I am accepting donations via PayPal. The money received will be used to sponsor Nuitka development.

## PayPal

You can support Nuitka development by making a donation through PayPal:
