# Support

If you have an issue or need support for Nuitka, here are your options:

## :material-star-circle: Commercial Grade Support

While Nuitka is Free Software, your software is not, and you want to get help with the tool, somebody to do it for you, or a quick solution, or even better IP protection with more advanced techniques. You are best served in the [Nuitka Commercial area](commercial.md).

!!! tip "Professional Support"
    For businesses and professional developers who need guaranteed support, SLA agreements, and priority assistance, commercial support provides dedicated expertise and faster resolution times.

## :material-github: GitHub Issue Tracker

Nuitka uses GitHub for public issue tracking (commercial users have a private tracker available) and you can report issues on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" rel="noopener" }.

!!! info "Before Creating an Issue"
    - Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
    - Include your Nuitka version and Python version
    - Provide a minimal reproducible example
    - Include relevant error messages and stack traces

## :material-chat: Discord / Gitter

Try the chat room on Discord, which although not a replacement for an issue tracker, can be used for first contact and questions. It is not an interactive User Manual though. Please refer to that first. You are also welcome to lurk and help others.
